# Bug-Byte

Bug Bytes is a game that allows a user to learn a new coding language with the help of our ape mascot. The user will be able to save their progress on their account. It will include several coding lessons that offer multiple-choice, short-answer, and code-writing questions (using a Java compiler embedded into the website).  Each lesson is designed to be entertaining and informational, with each lesson escalating accordingly. 

After completing each lesson, the user will be gifted an ape that will accompany them through each lesson at the corner of their screen. With coins gained from correct questions, the user can buy decorations and objects like bug repellents and hats. The further you get into the lessons, the more types of apes the user will gain, and the more cosmetics they can buy.
